This topic covers the causes of loops in a Layer 2 network and briefly explains how spanning tree protocol works. 
Redundancy is an important part of the hierarchical design for eliminating single points of failure and preventing 
disruption of network services to users. 
Redundant networks require the addition of physical paths, but logical redundancy must also be part of the design. 
Having alternate physical paths for data to traverse the network makes it possible for users to access network resources, despite path disruption. 
However, redundant paths in a switched Ethernet network may cause both physical and logical Layer 2 loops.

Ethernet LANs require a loop-free topology with a single path between any two devices. 
A loop in an Ethernet LAN can cause continued propagation of Ethernet frames until a link is disrupted and breaks the loop.

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a loop-prevention network protocol that allows for redundancy while creating a loop-free Layer 2 topology. 
IEEE 802.1D is the original IEEE MAC Bridging standard for STP.
------------------------------------------------------------
            ---Issues with Redundant Switch Links---

Path redundancy provides multiple network services by eliminating the possibility of a single point of failure. 
When multiple paths exist between two devices on an Ethernet network, and there is no spanning tree implementation 
on the switches, a Layer 2 loop occurs. A Layer 2 loop can result in MAC address table instability, 
link saturation, and high CPU utilization on switches and end-devices, resulting in the network becoming unusable.

Unlike the Layer 3 protocols, IPv4 and IPv6, Layer 2 Ethernet does not include a mechanism to recognize and eliminate endlessly looping frames. 
Both IPv4 and IPv6 include a mechanism that limits the number of times a Layer 3 networking device can retransmit a packet. 
A router will decrement the TTL (Time to Live) in every IPv4 packet, and the Hop Limit field in every IPv6 packet. 
When these fields are decremented to 0, a router will drop the packet. 
Ethernet and Ethernet switches have no comparable mechanism for limiting the number of times a switch retransmits a Layer 2 frame. 
STP was developed specifically as a loop prevention mechanism for Layer 2 Ethernet.
------------------------------------------------------------
            ---Layer 2 Loops---

Without STP enabled, Layer 2 loops can form, causing broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast frames to loop endlessly. 
This can bring down a network within a very short amount of time, sometimes in just a few seconds. 
For example, broadcast frames, such as an ARP Request are forwarded out all of the switch ports, except the original ingress port. 
This ensures that all devices in a broadcast domain are able to receive the frame. 
If there is more than one path for the frame to be forwarded out of, an endless loop can result. 
When a loop occurs, the MAC address table on a switch will constantly change with the updates from the 
broadcast frames, which results in MAC database instability. 
This can cause high CPU utilization, which makes the switch unable to forward frames.

Broadcast frames are not the only type of frames that are affected by loops. 
Unknown unicast frames sent onto a looped network can result in duplicate frames arriving at the destination device. 
An unknown unicast frame is when the switch does not have the destination MAC address in its MAC address table 
and must forward the frame out all ports, except the ingress port.
---------------------------------------------------------------
            ---Broadcast Storm---

A broadcast storm is an abnormally high number of broadcasts overwhelming the network during a specific amount of time. 
Broadcast storms can disable a network within seconds by overwhelming switches and end devices. 
Broadcast storms can be caused by a hardware problem such as a faulty NIC or from a Layer 2 loop in the network.

Layer 2 broadcasts in a network, such as ARP Requests are very common. 
A Layer 2 loop is likely to have immediate and disabling consequences on the network. 
Layer 2 multicasts are typically forwarded the same way as a broadcast by the switch. 
So, although IPv6 packets are never forwarded as a Layer 2 broadcast, ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery uses Layer 2 multicasts.
-------------------------------------------------------------
            ---The Spanning Tree Algorithm---

STP is based on an algorithm invented by Radia Perlman while working for Digital Equipment Corporation, 
and published in the 1985 paper "An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN.” 
Her spanning tree algorithm (STA) creates a loop-free topology by selecting a single root bridge where all 
other switches determine a single least-cost path.

Without the loop prevention protocol, loops would occur rendering a redundant switch network inoperable.
