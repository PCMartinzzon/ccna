            ---Steps to a Loop-Free Topology---

STA and STP functions, switches use Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to share information about themselves and their connections. 
BPDUs are used to elect the root bridge, root ports, designated ports, and alternate ports. 
Each BPDU contains a bridge ID (BID) that identifies which switch sent the BPDU. 
The BID is involved in making many of the STA decisions including root bridge and port roles. 
As shown in the figure, the BID contains a priority value, an extended system ID, and the MAC address of the switch. 
The lowest BID value is determined by the combination of these three fields.

    Bridge Priority

The default priority value for all Cisco switches is the decimal value 32768. 
The range is 0 to 61440 in increments of 4096. A lower bridge priority is preferable. 
A bridge priority of 0 takes precedence over all other bridge priorities.

    Extended System ID

The extended system ID value is a decimal value added to the bridge priority value in the BID to identify the VLAN for this BPDU.

Early implementations of IEEE 802.1D were designed for networks that did not use VLANs. 
There was a single common spanning tree across all switches. 
For this reason, in older switches, the extended system ID was not included in the BPDUs. 
As VLANs became common for network infrastructure segmentation, 802.1D was enhanced to include support for VLANs, 
which required that the 12-bit VLAN ID be included in the BPDU frame. 
VLAN information is included in the BPDU frame through the use of the extended system ID.

The extended system ID allows later implementations of STP to have different root bridges for different sets of VLANs. 
This can allow for redundant, non-forwarding links in a STP topology for one set of VLANs to be used 
by a different set of VLANs using a different root bridge.

    MAC address

When two switches are configured with the same priority and have the same extended system ID, the switch having the 
MAC address with the lowest value, expressed in hexadecimal, will have the lower BID.
-------------------------------------------------

            ---1. Elect the Root Bridge---

The STA designates a single switch as the root bridge and uses it as the reference point for all path calculations. 
Switches exchange BPDUs to build the loop-free topology beginning with selecting the root bridge.

An election process determines which switch becomes the root bridge. 
All switches in the broadcast domain participate in the election process. 
After a switch boots, it begins to send out BPDU frames every two seconds. 
These BPDU frames contain the BID of the sending switch and the BID of the root bridge, known as the Root ID.

The switch with the lowest BID will become the root bridge. 
At first, all switches declare themselves as the root bridge with their own BID set as the Root ID. 
Eventually, the switches learn through the exchange of BPDUs which switch has the lowest BID and will agree on one root bridge.
------------------------------------------------

            ---2. Elect the Root Ports---

After the root bridge has been determined, the STA algorithm is used to select the root port. 
Every non-root switch will select one root port. 
The root port is the port closest to the root bridge in terms of overall cost (best path) to the root bridge. 
This overall cost is known as the internal root path cost.
--------------------------------------------------

            ---3. Elect Designated Ports---

The loop prevention part of spanning tree becomes evident during these next two steps. 
After each switch selects a root port, the switches will then select designated ports.

Every segment between two switches will have one designated port. 
The designated port is a port on the segment (with two switches) that has the internal root path cost to the root bridge. 
In other words, the designated port has the best path to receive traffic leading to the root bridge.

What is not a root port or a designated port becomes an alternate or blocked port. 
The end result is a single path from every switch to the root bridge.
------------------------------------------------------

            ---4. Elect Alternate (Blocked) Ports---

If a port is not a root port or a designated port, then it becomes an alternate (or backup) port. 
Alternate ports and backup ports are in discarding or blocking state to prevent loops. 
-------------------------------------------------------

            ---STP Timers and Port States---

STP convergence requires three timers, as follows:

    *Hello Timer -The hello time is the interval between BPDUs. The default is 2 seconds but can be modified to between 1 and 10 seconds.

    *Forward Delay Timer -The forward delay is the time that is spent in the listening and learning state. 
    The default is 15 seconds but can be modified to between 4 and 30 seconds.

    *Max Age Timer -The max age is the maximum length of time that a switch waits before attempting to change the STP topology. 
    The default is 20 seconds but be modified to between 6 and 40 seconds.

Note: The default times can be changed on the root bridge, which dictates the value of these timers for the STP domain.

STP facilitates the logical loop-free path throughout the broadcast domain. 
The spanning tree is determined through the information learned by the exchange of the BPDU frames between the interconnected switches. 
If a switch port transitions directly from the blocking state to the forwarding state without information about the full 
topology during the transition, the port can temporarily create a data loop. 
For this reason, STP has five ports states, four of which are operational port states as shown in the figure. 
The disabled state is considered non-operational.

Note: To avoid problems with STP, IEEE recommends a maximum diameter of seven switches when using the default STP timers.
-------------------------------------------------


STP	            This is the original IEEE 802.1D version (802.1D-1998 and earlier) that provides a loop-free topology in a network with redundant links. 
                Also called Common Spanning Tree (CST), it assumes one spanning tree instance for the entire bridged network, regardless of 
                the number of VLANs.

PVST+	        Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST+) is a Cisco enhancement of STP that provides a separate 802.1D spanning tree instance for
                each VLAN configured in the network. PVST+ supports PortFast, UplinkFast, BackboneFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, 
                 and loop guard.

RSTP           	Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) or IEEE 802.1w is an evolution of STP that provides faster convergence than STP.

802.1D-2004	    This is an updated version of the STP standard, incorporating IEEE 802.1w.

Rapid PVST+	    This is a Cisco enhancement of RSTP that uses PVST+ and provides a separate instance of 802.1w per VLAN. 
                Each separate instance supports PortFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, and loop guard.

MSTP	        Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) is an IEEE standard inspired by the earlier Cisco proprietary Multiple 
                Instance STP (MISTP) implementation. MSTP maps multiple VLANs into the same spanning tree instance.

MST	            Multiple Spanning Tree (MST) is the Cisco implementation of MSTP, which provides up to 16 instances of 
                RSTP and combines many VLANs with the same physical and logical topology into a common RSTP instance. 
                Each instance supports PortFast, BPDU guard, BPDU filter, root guard, and loop guard.
