        ---Cisco switches have a proprietary protocol---

To enable trunking from a Cisco switch to a device that does not support DTP, use the switchport mode trunk and 
switchport nonegotiate interface configuration mode commands. 
This causes the interface to become a trunk, but it will not generate DTP frames.

S1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate

    ---re-enable dynamic trunking protocol---
S1(config-if)# switchport mode dynamic auto
